## Section: How to Write a Good Analysis
Before anything else, there's an important note that will be big for my own
presentation. I think I'll do a blog? That way I can just use a markdown doc
and host it on github pages, then just submit the link...

A good analysis connects musical details with questions like you've asked in
your proposal (maybe look that up???) to help understand what musical featur
es the composer has used to help articulate the feeligns or ideas you're get
ting from the music. In addition, your analysis should connect SOME of the
answers to the questions below to how you feel about the piece...


1. What kinds of repetition do you find in this piece?
    - in 90210, i immediately think of the repeated motif that follows
        throughout the intro, the up and down motion of the lead is some of
        my favorite sound to ever hit my eardrums...
    - for this, i could also mention the fact that there is that piano melo
        dy that seems to repeat the entire time
2. How do harmonic details (such as chord progressions) interact with the fo
   rm? Why do you think the composer makes these choices?
    - would be a good starting point to talk about the chord shifts in the
        transition and how jumpy they are? idk, it reflects the stark shift
        in sound from the beat switch to me...
3. What is the mood, expression, or feel of the piece? How does the composer
   use musical details to achieve this?
    - the mood is slow and meloncholic, almost exploratory, longing, which
        i feel reflects the theme of the lyrics quite well... it might be
        a good idea to also contrast this to the timbre of the beginning sec
        tion vs the ending; there is a clear contrast there that i think hel
        ps create that separation between the two sections...
4. Where is the climactic moment in the piece? How is this achieved?
    - i'm not sure how much this is going to contribute to my analysis
        necessarily, because i think my focus is going to be on the differen
        ce between the two halves.
5. How does the composer engage with the norms of common-practice music as
   we have discussed this semester?
    - i should look into the analysis for the piece first before i try to an
        swer this question
6. Be sure to comment on anything specifically important or memorable about
    the piece, and suggest why this is especially memorable

So I know that I want to make the focus of my blog the nostalgia and
melancholic tones that exist within 90210, but where can I start with that?
Also, I'm talking about the PIANO SETTING, not just 90210 in general.

In the one that I'm try to replicate, the key things that i want to replicat
e are:
- the intro has a blanket statement about the piece, so mine should be somet
    hing similar that comments on the clear divide between the two, right?
